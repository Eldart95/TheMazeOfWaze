# TheMazeOfWaze
* Created as an Object-Oriented-Programming Project during the second year at Ariel University
 in the Department of Computer Science, 2019.
* *Written on Eclipse.*

## Overview
This project is about Directed Weighted Graphs. Developing a data Structure of it, creating nodes and edges, and handling them in Java.
Including some useful functions (Computing shortest path between nodes, check if 2 nodes are connected and some more functions) described in the wiki pages.

The main purpose of my project is to visually draw a given graph and to be able to do some changes and some nice gui stuff while it's still up.
I used StdDraw from (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) to make a new gui window and use it as an app.
