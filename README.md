# TheMazeOfWaze
Created as an Object-Oriented-Programming Project during the second year at Ariel University
in the Department of Computer Science, 2019.

## Overview
This project is partially about developing a data Structure of a Directed Weighted Graphs, creating nodes and edges, and handling them in Java, including some
useful functions (Computing shortest path between nodes, check if 2 nodes are connected and some more functions) described in the wiki pages.

The main purpose of my project is to visually draw a given graph and to be able to do some changes and some nice gui stuff while it's still up.
I used StdDraw from (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) to make a new gui window and use it as an app.
