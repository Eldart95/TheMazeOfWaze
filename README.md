## Overview
This project is about Directed Weighted Graphs. Developing a data Structure of it, creating nodes and edges, and handling them in Java.
Including some useful functions (Computing shortest path between nodes, check if the graph is connected and some more functions) described in the wiki pages. This project is able to make a gui window (with JFrame) and use it to draw the graph we created.
